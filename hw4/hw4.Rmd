**Due date:** October 26 beginning of class.

Let's get some practice with **dplyr**! For this assignment, you will work with Mario Kart data! This data is made available as part of Tidy Tuesday. A codebook is available at https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2021/2021-05-25.

![Mario Kart](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/248411ba0d52bb38f1dccd3f74ed9d5a37f56aa95dbfb92518768b020959576c/68747470733a2f2f692e696e73696465722e636f6d2f356337643361313932363238393833663866373137623166)

First, load in dplyr. Make sure to install dplyr (or tidyverse in general) first before calling the packages. (Notice the chunk below uses warning=FALSE and message=FALSE so that unnecessary messages won't contaminate your md output!)

For the entire assignment, make sure to use dplyr functions only. (no base R!)

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
records <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-05-25/records.csv')
head(records)
```

Here are the variables included and their meanings:

- `track`: </t>Track name <br>
- `type`: </t>Single or three lap record  <br>
- `shortcut`: </t>Shortcut or non-shortcut record  <br>
- `player`: </t>Player‚Äôs name  <br>
- `system_played`: </t>Used system (NTSC or PAL)<br>
- `date`: </t>World record date  <br>
- `time_period`: </t>Time as hms period  <br>
- `time`: </t>Time in seconds  <br>
- `record_duration`: </t>Record duration in days  <br>


# Question 1
For the entire data, display the summary statistics (mean, median, mode, etc.) using the dplyr function `summary()` via pipe.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
records %>%
  summary()
```
# Question 2
Return the count of cases where a record was broken in more than a year (365 days).

```{r}
library(dplyr)
records %>% 
  filter( record_duration > 365 ) %>%
  nrow()
```
# Question 3
Return name of the player, name of the track, record date, and record duration for the record that took the longest time to be broken.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
longestDuration <- records %>%
  arrange(desc(record_duration)) %>%
  slice(1)
playerResult <- longestDuration %>%
  select(player, track, date, record_duration)
playerResult
```

# Question 4
Return the mean record time (`time`) by each track. What is the name of the track with the fastest average record time? *Hint: you should use `group_by() and summarize()*

```{r}
library(dplyr)
trackMean<-records %>%
  group_by(track) %>%
  summarize(meanTime = mean(time))
fastest <- trackMean %>%
  filter(meanTime == min(meanTime))
fastest

```
# Question 5
Let's get the year from the `date` column and save it as a variable named `year`. You can use the function `substr(date, 1, 4)` which grabs the first 4 digits in the `date` column. Use this expression in `mutate()` to create a `year` column. (Don't forget to save/overwrite the dataframe returned to the original one!)

```{r}
library(dplyr)
records <- records %>%
  mutate(year=substr(date,1,4))
head(records)
```

# Question 6
Now get the average record time (`time`) by year.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
avg <- records %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(meanTime=mean(time))
avg 
```
# Question 7
Continuing with your results in Question 6: Do you notice a trend across years? Are the record times getting faster, slower, or no clear pattern in time? Create a barplot where each year appears on the x axis (you can treat year as a categorical variable in this case) and y axis showing the mean record time in each year. Interpret your graph. *Hint: Use your code in Question 6, which returns the average record times by year, followed by ` %>% ggplot(aes(year,mean)) + geom_bar(stat='identity')` Hint2: To make your figure wider, you can insert fig.width=10 inside the curly brackets at the beginning of your r code chunk below, as {r, fig.width=10} which I already did for you below,*

```{r, fig.width=10}

library(ggplot2)
avg <- records %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(meanTime=mean(time))
avg %>%
  ggplot(aes(year, meanTime)) + geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  labs(x = "year", y= "Mean Record Time") + ggtitle("Mean Record Time by Year") + ggtitle("Mean Record Time by Year") + theme_minimal()
# Do you notice a trend across years? Are the record times getting faster, slower, or no clear pattern in time? (-2)

```

# Question 8
Create two overlaid histograms by `type` on the same plot where each histogram shows the distribution of `time` for a given track `type`. Combine dplyr and ggplot2 to achieve this. How do record times compare between Single Lap and Three Lap tracks? Hint: use `records %>% dplyr functions %>% ggplot(., aes()) + type of ggplot plot` to combine dpylr with ggplot. Note that the dot inside `ggplot()` is a placeholder for `records`, as dplyr has already pulled `records` df at the beginning of the code (making it unnecessary to type it twice!)

Note: Set `alpha=.5` for transparency.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
records %>%
  ggplot(aes(time,fill=type)) + geom_histogram(alpha=0.5, bins=30) + labs(x="Time", y="Frequency") + ggtitle("Distribution of Record Times by Type") + scale_fill_manual(values=c("Single Lap"="blue", "Three Lap"="red")) + theme_minimal()

# How do record times compare between Single Lap and Three Lap tracks? (-1)
```

# Question 9
Three Lap time reports the total time spent finishing three laps in total, as opposed to finishing a single lap. Let's divide all time observations with `type=="Three Lap"` by 3 to check whether **per lap** performance declines across Three Lap vs. Single Lap. Generate a new variable named `time_per` which is the time spent per round, and create two overlaid histograms of `type_per` by `type`. Hint: Use `mutate()`, and inside `mutate()` use `ifelse()` function to conditionally replace rows: e.g.., `ifelse(type=="Three Lap",time/3,time)` which divides `time` by three only if `type=="Three Lap"`.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

  records <- records %>%
  mutate(time_per = ifelse(type == "Three Lap", time / 3, time))
  
  records %>%
  ggplot(aes(time_per, fill = type)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, bins = 30) +
  labs(x = "Time per Lap", y = "Frequency") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Time per Lap by Track Type") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Single Lap" = "blue", "Three Lap" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal()

```
# Question 10
There appears to be recent discoveries of shortcuts within some of the tracks causing a number of extraordinarily fast records set in `Three Lap` tracks (Have you noticed this in your graph in Question 9?). Replicate your histogram in Question 9 with `shortcut=="No"` filter.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
records %>%
  filter(shortcut == "No") %>%
  ggplot(aes(time, fill = type)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, bins = 30) +
  labs(x = "Time", y = "Frequency") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Record Times") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Single Lap" = "blue", "Three Lap" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

# Question 11
Lastly, compare the mean `time` by `system_played`. Do you observe a difference across the two game systems? (Note: NTSC version of the game runs at 60 FPS (Frames Per Second), and PAL runs at 50 FPS!) Does this appear to affect performance of records set?

```{r}
library(dplyr)
timeComparison <- records %>%
  group_by(system_played) %>%
  summarize(meanTime = mean(time))
timeComparison
```
There is a difference in performance between the two game systems. Records in the NTSC system have faster times compared to the PAL system on average which likely allows players to complete races more quickly. Hence, time frame difference may appear to affect the performance of records sets. 

You are done! üèÅ Don't forget to commit and push your .Rmd file to your Github repository before the due date. (Well... the checkered flag emoji is now super relevant for this assignment!)
